# Introduction:

In this section, the objective was to develop a code to scrape and gather information from the webpage located at: 

https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html. 

The task involved automating the collection of data from the webpage and then utilizing the BeautifulSoup library to parse and format the scraped data into a readable format.

# Procedure:
_____________________________

Scraping the Webpage: The first step involved extracting the HTML code of the webpage using a web browser. This allowed us to understand the structure of the data.

Data Cleaning: Once the data was obtained, the next step was to clean it by removing any unwanted characters or words, typically represented in CSS and HTML.

Data Storage: All the relevant data was stored in the form of titles and previews, making it easily accessible and understandable for anyone reading the extracted information.
